# Description

This is quick and rough demo code for esp32-p4-ev-board, sorry for posting this "Frankenstein creature". This demo combines usb host with midi class, lvgl and kind of is emulating novation launchpad mini mk3.


# The story

At first i wanted to test P4 with my old USB host code. When it started working more or less i thought it may be good time to see if i can do something with midi (there was some request in my old arduino library). I decided to buy some midi device and the choice was novation launchapad mini mk3 (it was fairly cheap $50-ish).

For this code i dont provide support, since its just a demo, but i can try to answer some question. I decided to post it to show "cool" demo, not a functional code.
